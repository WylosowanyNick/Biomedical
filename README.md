# Biomedical

Repo containing projects in the field of Biomedical Engineering.

## Amplitude modulation

The scope of work in this project includes the creation of a virtual instrument in the LabView graphical environment, which will be used to analyze the properties of the voltage gain path with amplitude modulation for simulated signals.

This project includes 2 simulation subprojects. Namely simulator of:
- amplitude modulation/demodulation,
- amplification path with amplitude modulation.

## Statistical Dominance Algorithm

The aim of this project is implementation of [Statistical Dominance Algorithm](https://home.agh.edu.pl/~pioro/sda/) as [3D Slicer](https://www.slicer.org/) extensions.

## Podoscopy

The aim of the project is determination of diagnostic parameters for the data acquired using podoscopy platform. The data consists of:

- sequential images of footprints made during natural gait,
- reaction of the ground as a result of foot pressure on the podoscopy platform.
